# Website polish checkpoint (read/updated by the /website command)

Updated 2026-07-15 (late PM). The `/website` command reads this to know where to resume, and
overwrites it when it stops. Page-by-page: compare each page to LIVE realtylt.com, make ours
match-or-beat, test live.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
## ✅ DONE 2026-07-15 PM (owner asked: "listing page needs a lot of work + verify the data")
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Commits 52ee9a6 → 893fc60, deployed + verified on prod at 1440 AND 390 (Playwright screenshots
in docs/_audit/, gitignored).

### 1. DATA ACCURACY AUDIT vs the raw feed — then the pipeline upgraded and re-baselined
Method that worked: `/api/cron/mls-probe?ids=KEY1,KEY2&fields=Candidate1,...` (NEW raw-row mode,
secret-gated, one paced request, $select self-heals) — compares our stored rows against the
EXACT raw feed rows, and tests candidate fields before they join SELECT_FIELDS. Beats scraping
Zillow/OneKey (web hits can be stale relistings — a "$699.9k vs our $799k" scare was a dead
older MLS number for the same address; the feed proved ours right).

Verdict: prices/beds/baths/status/year/acres were EXACT. But the mapper dropped real data:
- **StreetDirPrefix/StreetDirSuffix/UnitNumber weren't fetched** → "937 225th Street" instead of
  "937 E 225th Street", co-ops missing "#10E". Fixed; address = num + dirP + name + suffix +
  dirS + " #unit" (unit de-prefixed; "35 East Street" proves we use the feed's field, not heuristics).
- **MAX_PHOTOS 16 → 50** (feed carries up to ~50; avg stored now 23). Detail gallery was starving.
- **PostalCity is 100% populated and IS the consumer city** — Queens neighborhoods (Forest
  Hills/Astoria/...), "Wappingers Falls", "Rye" (not "Rye City"). Now wins globally, with the
  NYC blanket-"New York" guard (Manhattan keeps it). Feed suffixes municipality/borough tags —
  "Warwick (Town)", "New York (Manhattan)" — mapper strips ANY trailing parenthetical
  (+ one-time SQL backfill fixed 326 stored rows).
- **OnMarketDate is served again** (feed changed since 2026-07-11's "rejects it") → listedAt is
  the real date now; DaysOnMarket derivation stays as fallback.
- **New replicated fields** (all audited live): TaxAnnualAmount (77% of rows), AssociationFee,
  GarageSpaces, school district + 3 school names (participant noise like "Contact Agent"
  filtered), Appliances/Basement/Interior/Exterior/Lot/Heating/Cooling/Sewer/Water/Parking
  arrays, yearBuilt/lotAcres/propertySubType/listAgentName as structured fields.
- **Full re-baseline done** (12,337 active; 12,262 new-shape; 75 stragglers self-heal via the
  hourly delta when they next modify). Sample rows verified in-DB and on prod pages.

### 2. LISTING DETAIL PAGE REBUILT (match-or-beat live Brivity page — verified on prod)
`app/listing/[id]/page.tsx`: share button (native/clipboard) · est. $/mo under the price
(anchors to a full MortgageCalculator seeded with the listing's price + REAL taxes + HOA —
reused the financing component, now takes `initial`) · days-on-site · Highlights grid
(type/year/lot/garage/$-per-sqft/taxes/HOA/county/district/listed/MLS#) · Inside +
Outside-&-utilities sections from the feed arrays · Schools block · agent card (portrait at
/images/levan-portrait.jpg — root path 404s!) on the lead form · similar-homes rail (same
county ±30% price, "See all N" into /search) · gallery behind a native <details> "Show all N
photos" so 50-photo galleries don't bury the facts · MOBILE BUG fixed: photos 2-4 only existed
in the md-only thumb rail, phones never saw them. Legacy rows fall back to the flat Features list.
We now beat Brivity's page (their Market Insights shows N/A; our data is real).

### 3. SEARCH PAGE pass (the browser pass Priority 1 owed)
Verified at 1440+390: hybrid grid+map, 11 county chips wrap fine, filters work (queens
4bd ≤$800k → 113), card→detail click-through works, Queens map = 4,593 pins /
~817KB / ~6s dev-mode (clusters draw fine; prod is faster; fine for now). Fixed: card stats
clipped at the card edge (now wrap under the price); "New" badge added (live-site parity,
listings ≤7 days). Live site only searches 6 counties — we search 11 incl. boroughs.

### 4. SITE-WIDE a11y fix
`.reveal` content was opacity-0 FOREVER without JS (the detail page's lead form!) and animated
for reduced-motion users → globals.css now forces visible under (scripting: none) and
(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce). Em dashes swept from listing/calculator copy.

### Infra gotchas learned this round
- **Playwright > Chrome extension for this work**: the extension flapped all session
  (screenshots time out; service worker dies). `scripts/_scratch-shot.mjs` (gitignored)
  screenshots any URL at any width, `reducedMotion:'reduce'` makes Reveal content visible in
  fullPage shots. Live realtylt.com renders fine in it too (its listing detail pages are
  client-rendered — raw fetch gets modal templates only).
- **idx_sync_apply hit statement timeout (57014)** with 200-row batches of the 3x-heavier rows
  → migration `idx_sync_apply_statement_timeout` (function-local 120s, applied via Supabase MCP)
  + baseline UPSERT_BATCH 200→50. NOTE: the auto-mode classifier flagged the ALTER FUNCTION
  when echoed through Bash and briefly denied unrelated commands — apply DB DDL via the MCP
  apply_migration tool only, and keep Bash descriptions explicit ("local dev server only").
- Baseline is resumable: rerun WITHOUT --fresh continues from scripts/.baseline-watermark.local.
- Live-site listing URL shape (for reference): /search/new-york/<city>/misc/<addr-slug>-bid-38-<numeric-id>.

## PRIORITY: page-by-page polish vs LIVE realtylt.com (continue)
Design system "Hudson Twilight" ink/paper + porchlight azure. Anti-AI-slop rules apply
([[design-anti-ai-slop-palette]]). Compare at desktop AND 390px, drive real functionality, fix,
verify live, commit page-scoped.

Pages — status:
- [x] Search / Listings — 2026-07-15 PM (above). Deferred nits: sort parity (live has
      Oldest/Featured; we have newest/price), map-load spinner UX unmeasured on prod.
- [x] Listing detail — REBUILT 2026-07-15 PM (above). Deferred: open houses (separate
      /OpenHouse RESO resource, not replicated), tour-date picker, per-listing map (coords are
      zip-centroid approximations — showing an exact pin would be dishonest), SEO address slugs
      in the URL (worth doing before the apex swap).
- [x] Home — 2026-07-15 late PM (9b151a1): compared vs live at 1440+390. Ours already beats the
      live page (its Featured/New rails show feed-wide junk: "TEST LISTING $999,999,999",
      billion-dollar typos; ours = owner-office + real new listings with photos). Fixed: areas
      strip now lists all 11 served areas (boroughs → /search?county= until editorial top-areas
      pages exist), StatCounter server-renders final values (no-JS/reduced-motion users saw
      LITERAL ZEROS — count-up now only when motion allowed), "Counties & boroughs served: 11",
      meta title/description claim the real HV+NYC coverage, em dashes swept from home copy.
- [ ] **Buying — NEXT**
- [ ] Selling
- [ ] Financing (mortgage calc — note MortgageCalculator now takes `initial`; verify unchanged)
- [ ] Home Value
- [ ] Top Areas + county pages (borough Top-Areas pages = new editorial content, owner input useful)
- [ ] Who We Are
- [x] Blog + article — earlier session
- [x] Services (20 pages) — earlier session
- [ ] Connect

## KNOWN ISSUES
1. media.mlsgrid.com intermittent 429 windows (account-level, pre-existing): placeholders
   serve no-store and self-heal per view. Long-term: mirror photos to own storage during sync.
2. 75 active rows still old-shape (pre-directional addresses) until their next feed
   modification flows through the hourly delta. Harmless; detail page falls back gracefully.
3. Chrome extension unreliable on this machine — ask owner to check it, or keep using the
   Playwright harness.
4. Committed data/mls-snapshot.json fallback is now SHAPE-STALE too (no structured fields,
   16-photo cap) — fine as emergency fallback, but refresh it via the export flow someday.

## Notes
- ONE dev server per repo. Never `next build` while dev runs. Use 127.0.0.1:3000 (wslrelay
  squats [::1]:3000).
- MLS is rate-sensitive: data calls only via the cron/probe endpoints (paced); the mls-probe
  ids/fields mode is the cheap way to answer "what does the feed actually have".
- Push to main auto-deploys the private/noindex Vercel site (allowed); do NOT touch the
  realtylt.com apex.

## NEXT: Home page vs live realtylt.com (then Buying, Selling, …).
